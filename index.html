    <ul>

    <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_doctype.asp">&lt!DOCTYPE html &gt</a>  This is the document type
        declaration, not a tag. It declares that the document is an HTML5 document.</li>
    <li> <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html-html-tag/">&lt html &gt </a>  This is called the HTML root element.
        All other elements are contained within it.</li>
    <li> <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html-head-tag/">&lt head &gt</a> The head tag contains the “behind the
        scenes” elements for a webpage. Elements within the head aren’t visible on the front end of a webpage. Typical
        elements inside the

        <head> include:</li>
    <li> <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/TAGS/tag_title.asp">&lttitle$gt></a>: Defines the title displayed on the
        browser tab.</li>

    <li> <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html-title-tag/">&lttitle$gt> </a>  The title is what is displayed on the
        top of your browser when you visit a website and contains the title of the webpage that you are viewing.</li>
        <li> <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html-heading/"><b>$lth2$gt</b> </a></li>

        <p>
        Unlike other programming languages, HTML does not show output on the compiler. Web browsers show the
        results of an HTML code.

        It reads HTML files and determines how to show content with the help of HTML tags. Any web browser
        (Google, Safari, Mozilla Firefox, etc) can be used to open a . HTML file and view the results.
